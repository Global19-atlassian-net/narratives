abstract: "It has been twenty years since West Nile virus first emerged in the Americas, and since then, little progress has been made to control outbreaks caused by this virus. Using Nextstrain, we investigate the emergence of West Nile virus in the United States, followed by its rapid spread, evolution in a new environment, establishment of endemic transmission, and subsequent international spread."

### When was West Nile virus first introduced?
Genomic investigations revealed that West Nile virus was likely first introduced in the United States 1 year before the outbreak in New York in 1999.  

### Where did the virus come from?
Phylogenetic comparisons showed that West Nile virus sequences isolated from New York in 1999 were most closely related to a WNV isolate from Israel, suggesting a potential origin from the Middle East.

### How did it get there?
Although it is impossible to determine exactly how WNV was introduced, human transportation of infected birds or mosquitoes, is the more plausible mechanism for the introduction of WNV from the Middle East into the U.S.

P.S. Currently we can't show the map here as the israeli isolate messes up the map bounds and US looks too small. I'll fix this but not in time for publication.

With its international spread, WNV have shown its growing burden outside the U.S. This virus is now endemic in several southern Canadian provinces, in Central America and the Caribbean, and also in South America, reaching Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina. Evidences suggest that migratory birds may be important factors for WNV dissemination throughout the Americas.
Despite genome sequencing being essential to accurately reconstruct WNV spread and outbreak dynamics, currently only 18 WNV genomes are available from Latin America and the Caribbean, and none from Canada. In spite of such limitations, the available genomic data were enough to reveal multiple, southwards WNV introductions since early stages of the U.S. outbreak: the genotypes WN02 and SW03 were introduced in Mexico; WN02 was found in the Caribbean; and NY99 is likely circulating in South America.
Although Latin American countries show suitable ecological conditions for the establishment of WNV, large human WNV outbreaks have not yet been detected in the region, despite serologic studies in resident birds showing that WNV is likely endemic throughout the region. In light of these findings, the apparent lack of large outbreaks could be explained (i) by WNV cases being masked, misdiagnosed as other flavivirus infections, or (ii) by immune cross-protection provided by other endemic flaviviruses.

Note that I can't change the resolution here (!!!! BUG) I'll work on this before submission
